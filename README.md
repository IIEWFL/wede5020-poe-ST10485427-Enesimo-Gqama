TIMELINE AND MILESTONES

Week 1: Planning and collecting content information.

Week 2: Building the HTML structure and navigation implementation.

Week 3: CSS styling and respective designs. 

Week 4: Testing, Debugging and Deployment.

PART 1

Part 1 was primarily about developing the design of the HTML which consists of five pages: the home page(index.html), our programs page(programs.html), the get involved page(get-involved.html) and the contact page(contact.html), as well as filling it with the information obtained from the chosen proposal. 

PART 2 

Using an external CSS stylesheet enables centralised and organised styling across a website, making it easier to manage and update. The site adapts fluidly to different screen sizes thanks to mobile-responsive design and media queries, resulting in an ideal user experience on smartphones, tablets, and PCs. Establishing a uniform colour palette and typography improves visual cohesion and brand identification, while cross-browser compatibility guarantees that the website runs and shows appropriately across all major web browsers, offering a dependable and professional appearance to all users. 

PART 3 

Incorporating JavaScript interaction and form validation improves user experience by making websites more dynamic and ensuring that user inputs are correct and safe. Comprehensive SEO optimisation boosts the site's exposure in search engine results, resulting in increased traffic and engagement. Implementing strong security measures safeguards both the website and its users against potential threats and weaknesses. Furthermore, performance improvements, such as faster loading times and more efficient resource management, guarantee that the website functions smoothly, delivering a fast and seamless experience for all visitors.

Part 3

SEO AND MARKETING STRATEGY

On-page SEO was implemented with an emphasis on targeted keywords including "Botshabelo babies home", "Midtand preschool", and "children's charity South Africa", as well as optimised meta titles, descriptions and clear heading hierarchy with internal links. Technical SEO improvements included a sitemap, robots.txt setting and canonical URLs. The off-page SEO strategy prioritised backlink creation through local company directories, non-profit platfors, community collaborations and press releases as well as social media integration using Open Graph tags and platform specific tactics. Local SEO optimisation included using location specific keywords, providing consistent contact information, integrating Google Maps and preparing for local business directory submissions.

SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION

To improve website security, strong protection measures were implemented such as a strict content security policy to control resource loading, XSS protection headers to prevent cross site scripting, frame protection to prevent clickjacking attempts and MIME sniffing prevention to ensure proper content type recognition.

PERFORMANCE OPTIMISATION

The website's loading time was improved by properly scaled pictures with lazy loading, effective CSS and JavaScript performance and streamlined resource management for faster asset delivery. The user experience was further improved with a mobile-first design, progressive enhancement to provide core funtionality for all users and extensive corss-device testing to ensure a uniform experience across all platforms.
